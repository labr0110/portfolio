Andy is what you may call me. Having that common black and white mentality, Graphic Design gives me a chance to live the different shades of grey through my designs. It allows me to empathize and to see things in different perspectives. It forces me to explore the different styles and to keep up with the latest design trends. It enables me to solve problems in a rational way, while designing in an emotion way. Graphic Design is the best of both worlds, and I just happen to have a passion for it.
